## Project Overview
This project, created for the **STAT3013.P12.CTTT course**, focuses on analyzing and predicting the **Amazon stock price** using advanced statistical methods and machine learning models.

We employ:
- **Descriptive Statistics** to summarize and visualize key features of the dataset.
- **Inferential Statistics** to draw meaningful insights and test hypotheses.
- **Time-Series Models** including **ARIMA**, **LSTM**, and **Transformer** for forecasting stock prices.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical Amazon stock prices

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting the dataset for analysis.  
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing historical trends and key insights.  
   - Calculating descriptive statistics.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Testing relationships between variables.  
   - Performing stationarity tests and data transformation for time-series modeling.

4. **Model Implementation**  
   - Implementing ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer models.  
   - Comparing their performance based on metrics like RMSE and MAE.

5. **Result Interpretation**  
   - Analyzing the forecast results from each model.  
   - Evaluating which model performs best for Amazon stock price prediction.
